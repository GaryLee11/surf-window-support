## FAQ

### 1) How do I add or remove favorite spots?
- Open **Manage Spots**
- Tap **+** to add a spot (up to 3 favorites)
- Tap **×** to remove a favorite

### 2) Why can’t I add more than 3 spots?
Surf Window is designed for fast decisions. The MVP supports up to **3** favorite spots for clarity and speed.

### 3) How does “Go / Maybe / No” work?
The decision is calculated from:
- Your rules (minimum wave height, tide preference)
- The current forecast for the selected spot  
You can change rules anytime in **Adjust Rules**.

### 4) Alerts are not working. What should I do?
1. Open **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Make sure notifications are **Allowed**
3. If denied, tap **Open Settings** to enable notifications
4. Re-enable your alert in **Alerts** tab

### 5) Location permission: why do you need it?
Location is used only to show nearby surf spots. If you don’t allow location access, you can still use the app by selecting spots manually.

### 6) Offline mode / weak signal
When Offline Mode is enabled, Surf Window will show cached results (if available).

## Troubleshooting
- Restart the app
- Check your internet connection (if Offline Mode is off)
- Update to the latest version from the App Store
